# Simple Linear Static Analysis of a TV Mount

I found this cool TV wall mount claiming it could hold up a 100kg TV. I was curious if that was really possible so I reverse engineered it as a base for learning simple structural analysis in Solidworks.

## Concepts Explored
* Part an assembly configurations (like Arrangements in NX)
* Components Interactions in Simulation (Bonded, Contact, Virtual Wall, Free)
* Symmetric constrained

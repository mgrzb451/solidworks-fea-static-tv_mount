# Simple Linear Static Analysis of a TV Mount
I found this cool TV wall mount claiming it could hold up a 100kg TV. I was curious if that was really possible so I reverse engineered it as a base for learning simple structural analysis in Solidworks.

## Concepts Explored
* Part and assembly configurations (like Arrangements in NX)
* Component Interactions in Simulation (Bonded, Contact, Virtual Wall, Free)
    * Local Face Interactions > Global Bodies Interactions
* Symmetry constrain
* Distributed mass load
